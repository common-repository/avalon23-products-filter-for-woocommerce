### Avalon23 Products Filter Features:

&#9989;&nbsp; **Image Map** This is a filter type - an image with filter elements located on it. Demo ["Types or Ship from"](https://demo.avalon23.dev/)

&#9989;&nbsp; **Save search query(filter memory)** This function allows the user to save the search query. And when switching to another page or if the user visits the page the next day, the filter selection will remain. Demo ["Filter with memory"](https://cars.avalon23.dev/)

&#9989;&nbsp; **QR code of current search** This feature displays the QR code of the current search query. Docs ["QR code"](https://avalon23.dev/document/avalon23_qr/) Demo ["QR of search"](https://demo.avalon23.dev/?av1_product_cat=78&av1_filter_id=1)

&#9989;&nbsp; **SEO links** The search query can have a human-readable form in the URL. An example: https://your_site.com/search/color-red/season-autumn/product_cat-hoodies/  And the plugin also has SEO settings that improve the indexing of pages with search results.

&#9989;&nbsp; **Mobile behavior** Filter Location Changes for [Mobile Devices](https://avalon23.dev/how-to-customize-the-filters-mobile-behavior/). Popup sidebar (left/right) or in content

&#9989;&nbsp; **Dynamic calculation** The plugin will show relevant filters depending on the current search query or category page

&#9989;&nbsp; **ACF filter** Filtering by fields of this type: Text, Text Area, Number, Range, Select, Radio Button, Button Group, True/False, Date Time Picker

&#9989;&nbsp; **Hierarchy dropdown** This type of filter only works with hierarchical taxonomy. You can see how it works here [Demo1](https://demo.avalon23.dev/hierarchy-dropdown/) AND [Demo2](https://cars.avalon23.dev/tyres/)This type of filter has the feature of switching the image depending on the hierarchy level(You can check  it  here ["Tyres"](https://cars.avalon23.dev/tyres/)). This helps the user to correctly navigate the search.

&#9989;&nbsp; **Performance** The plugin has options to optimize CSS and JS files. Also caching which reduces the number of queries to the database. Also, flexible configuration of each filter element will allow you to optimize queries by disabling dynamic recalculation where it is not needed.

&#9989;&nbsp; **Text search by attribute** Text search can work not only by title and description of products, but also by taxonomies(Attributes, Categories, Tags) and custom field

&#9989;&nbsp; **Flexibility**  The ability to customize the width, state, visibility of each filter depending on the screen width of the current device

&#9989;&nbsp; **Predefinition** allows to display filter that adapts to the current request by default.

&#9989;&nbsp; **WCAG 2.0**

&#9989;&nbsp; **Searc logic**   IN – standard logic – shows all products that have at least one of the selected terms.  AND – shows products that have all of the selected terms. NOT IN –  exclude products that have at least one of the selected terms

&#9989;&nbsp; **Universality** Plugin can filter by: Price, title, category, attributes, tags, custom taxonomies, meta(custom) fields, product dimensions, date, SKU, etc... 

&#9989;&nbsp; **Skins** Filters can have different [color schemes](https://demo.avalon23.dev/skins/?av23_pa_season=24&av23_filter_id=11&av23_pa_color=71&av23_product_cat=80&av23_pa_size=74&av23_on_sale=1&av23_price=2:77). And you can also choose custom filter colors to suit the design of your theme.

&#9989;&nbsp; **Ajax mode** Fast and light Ajax filtering. In this mode, filtering occurs without reloading the page. This feature depends on the current theme

&#9989;&nbsp; **Many types of filters** checkbox, radio, slider, datepicker, labels, select, multi select, tesxt input, hierarchical dropdown, image(in full version), color(in full version)
